# city-scapes

City-Scapes is an application that allows user to search for any city in the world by name to learn about that city. User inputs the name of city and is provided with the city's population, a link to the city's Wiki Data, and a current picture of that city’s downtown area which the user can then click on to enlarge. Included in search results are four facts: “Cost of Living”; “Salary Calculator”; “Climate”; and “Crime Rates”.  The app then retains information on which cities they searched for by storing the data in local storage. 
This application utilizes several APIs to populate the data links: “teleport API” finds the picture and four main facts; "GeoDB Cities API" returns the city population and Wiki Data, "OpenWeather API" gets the city's coordinates, and “City Bikes API” finds information on bike rentals. Styling was done using “Materialize”.
