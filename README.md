# city-scapes

City-Scapes is an application that allows user to search for any city in the world by name to learn about that city. User inputs the name of city and is provided with current picture of that city’s downtown area which user can then click on to enlarge. Included in search results are four facts: “Cost of Living”; “Salary Calculator”; “Climate”; and “Crime Rates”.  The app then retains information on which cities they searched for by storing the data in local storage. If the user chooses to find out more information, they can then click on the link to Modal that will inform them of INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE.
This application utilizes several APIs to populate the data links: “teleport API” finds the picture and four main facts; “ELLEN’S API” finds information ABOUT STUFF. Styling was done using “materialize API”.
